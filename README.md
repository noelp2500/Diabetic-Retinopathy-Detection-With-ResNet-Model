# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-With-ResNet-Model

Diabetic Retinopathy is a disease that results from complication of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and affects patients eyes.
The disease can develop if blood sugar levels are left uncontrolled for a long period of time.
It is caused by damage of blood vessels in the retina which is located in the back of patient's eyes.

It is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. 
WHO estimates that 347 million people have this disease worldwide.

The types of images stored are - NO_DR, MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, PROLIFERATIVE_DR

I have built a ResNet model to detect the presence of Diabetic Retinopathy in a person's eyes.
